Collection of cross-platform routines to operate effectively sparse array. A sparse array is an vector of intervals which splits number space into two subsets, internal and external. ArraySparse leverage iterating, inverting, minimizing and other operations on a sparse array. Use the module to increase memory efficiency of your algorithms.

### Try out from the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Wandalen/wArraySparse
cd wArraySparse
will .npm.install
node sample/trivial/Sample.s
```

Make sure you have utility `willbe` installed. To install willbe: `npm i -g willbe@stable`. Willbe is required to build of the module.

### To add to your project

```
npm add 'warraysparse@stable'
```
